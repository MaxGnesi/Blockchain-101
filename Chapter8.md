# Chapter 8: Trading Instruments
## Perpetuals, Options & Collateral Mechanics

While DeFi offers decentralized trading, centralized exchanges (CEXs) dominate derivatives trading with perpetuals and options. Understanding these instruments—and critically, collateral mechanics—is essential for navigating crypto markets.

## Perpetual Contracts (Perps)

### What Makes Perpetuals Unique

Unlike traditional futures with expiry dates, perpetuals trade continuously:

```
Traditional Futures:
Contract → Expiry date → Settlement → New contract

Perpetuals:
Contract → No expiry → Funding payments → Trades forever
```

### The Funding Rate Mechanism

Funding rates keep perpetual prices anchored to spot through periodic payments:

```
When perp > spot price:
Longs pay shorts every 8 hours
→ Incentivizes shorting
→ Price converges to spot

When perp < spot price:
Shorts pay longs every 8 hours
→ Incentivizes longing
→ Price converges to spot
```

**Funding Rate Calculation:**
```
Funding = Position Size × Funding Rate × Leverage
Rate typically = (Perp - Spot) / Spot × adjustment

Example with leverage:
BTC perp: $30,100, Spot: $30,000
Rate = 0.01% (longs pay)
$10,000 capital at 10x leverage = $100,000 position
Pays $10 every 8 hours (0.01% of $100,000)
```

### The Economics of Funding Rates

**In theory, funding rates should reflect several components:**

```
Theoretical Funding Rate = 
    Base Cost of Carry (borrowing cost)
    + Risk Premiums (convexity, liquidation)
    + Supply/Demand Imbalance
```

**1. Base Cost of Carry (The Arbitrage Floor)**
```
Without this component, there would be free arbitrage:

If funding < borrowing cost:
→ Borrow USD, buy spot, short perp
→ Collect funding > pay interest
→ Risk-free profit!

Therefore: Funding must AT LEAST cover borrowing costs
This creates a theoretical floor based on prevailing rates
```

**2. Risk Premiums (Different for Each Perp Type)**

Different perpetual types create different non-linear risk profiles:

```
USDT-Margined (Linear) Shorts face:
→ Liquidation risk (discontinuous loss at specific price)
→ Need to source USDT collateral
→ Binary risk profile despite linear instrument

Coin-Margined (Inverse) Shorts face:
→ Non-linear position dynamics (position size drifts)
→ Collateral/position interaction effects
→ Continuous rebalancing requirements

Over time, funding should compensate for these risks
Otherwise, no one would provide liquidity on short side
```

**3. Supply/Demand Imbalance (Market Reality)**
```
Crypto Market Structure:
- Retail: Predominantly long-biased (speculation)
- Institutions: Need shorts for hedging
- Result: Structural long > short demand

This tilts funding above theoretical minimums
Actual levels depend entirely on:
- Market sentiment
- Positioning extremes
- Liquidity conditions
- Macro environment
```

### Linear vs Inverse Perpetuals - Understanding the Trade-offs

**Linear Perpetuals (USDT-margined):**
```
Mechanics:
- Collateral: USDT/USDC
- P&L: Linear in USD terms
- 1 BTC move = $1 P&L per $1 notional
- Fixed USD exposure regardless of BTC price

Example (corrected):
Long $30,000 worth of BTC at $30,000/BTC
BTC rises to $31,000
Profit = ($31,000 - $30,000) × 1 = $1,000 USDT
Return = 3.33%
```

**Inverse Perpetuals (Coin-margined):**
```
Mechanics:
- Collateral: The crypto asset itself
- P&L: Non-linear in USD terms
- Contract size typically fixed in USD (e.g., $100 per contract)
- Your BTC exposure changes with price

Example (corrected):
Long 300 contracts at $100 each = $30,000 notional
Entry: $30,000/BTC → Position = 1 BTC worth
Exit: $31,000/BTC → Position still 1 BTC worth

P&L in BTC = (1/$30,000 - 1/$31,000) × $30,000 
           = 0.0322 BTC
USD value = 0.0322 × $31,000 = $1,000
Return = 3.33% (same as linear in this case)

But the non-linearity appears in collateral/position interactions...
```

### Understanding Non-Linear Risk in Perpetuals

**Key Concept: Linear instruments can create non-linear risk profiles**

While perpetuals themselves are linear derivatives (1:1 price movement), the complete risk profile becomes non-linear due to:

```
1. LEVERAGE EFFECTS
   - Magnifies percentage moves
   - Creates liquidation points
   - Transforms linear moves into binary outcomes

2. COLLATERAL DYNAMICS
   - Collateral value changes with market (for crypto collateral)
   - Position size in USD terms shifts (for inverse)
   - Creates feedback loops

3. MARGIN MECHANICS
   - Liquidation creates discontinuous losses
   - Maintenance margin requirements
   - Auto-deleveraging risks

Result: Your actual P&L curve is NOT a straight line
```

**Practical Impact:**
- USDT perps: Linear until liquidation, then total loss (discontinuous)
- Inverse perps: Continuous drift in position size (smooth non-linearity)
- Both require different risk management approaches

### Non-Linear Risk Profiles in Hedged Positions

**While perpetuals are linear instruments, leverage and collateral dynamics create non-linear risk profiles:**

#### **Hedge Strategy A: Spot + USDT Perp Short (Discontinuous Risk)**
```
Setup: Long 10 BTC spot + Short $300k USDT perp

Market Behavior:
BTC +20%: Perfect hedge maintained (still 1:1 ratio)
BTC -20%: Perfect hedge maintained
Risk: Discontinuous loss at liquidation point

Risk Profile: NON-LINEAR DUE TO LIQUIDATION
━━━━━━━━━━┃  ← Liquidation point
Linear P&L ┃  Total loss of collateral

✓ Clean, predictable hedge until liquidation
✓ No position drift
✗ Discontinuous jump to total loss
✗ Need external USDT collateral
```

#### **Hedge Strategy B: Spot + Inverse Perp Short (Continuous Non-Linearity)**
```
Setup: Long 10 BTC spot + Short 10 BTC worth inverse perp
(Using BTC as collateral for the short)

Market Moves Up 20%:
- Spot: 10 BTC now worth 20% more ✓
- Short perp: Loses BTC from collateral
- You now have ~8 BTC backing same USD short
- Result: UNDER-HEDGED (non-linear position drift)

Market Moves Down 20%:
- Spot: 10 BTC worth 20% less
- Short perp: Gains BTC 
- You now have ~12 BTC (but each worth less)
- Result: OVER-HEDGED (asymmetric change)

Risk Profile: NON-LINEAR POSITION DYNAMICS
╱╱╱╱╱╱╱╱╱  ← Continuous drift
Position size changes with price moves

✓ No liquidation cliff
✓ Use BTC as natural collateral
✗ Non-linear hedge degradation
✗ Requires constant rebalancing
```

### Why This Matters for Funding Rates

**The funding rate compensates for these different non-linear risk profiles:**

```
USDT Perp Funding Reflects:
- Base borrowing cost (or arbitrage would exist)
- Liquidation risk premium
- Supply/demand imbalance

Inverse Perp Funding Reflects:
- Base borrowing cost
- Non-linear position management costs
- Supply/demand imbalance

Key Insight: Inverse funding often exceeds linear funding
This reflects the operational complexity and continuous 
rebalancing required to manage position drift.

Actual rates vary widely with market conditions:
- Can spike dramatically in bull markets
- Can go negative in bear markets
- Change rapidly with positioning and sentiment
```

### How Funding Relates to Market Conditions

```
Theoretical Foundation:
- Funding must exceed borrowing costs (or arbitrage exists)
- Additional premiums for operational risks
- Market supply/demand drives deviations

Example Scenario:
If USD borrowing costs = 5% annually
Then 8-hour funding baseline = 5% / 365 / 3 = 0.0046%

Actual funding depends on:
- Market sentiment (euphoria vs fear)
- Positioning (crowded longs vs balanced)
- Volatility (risk premiums expand/contract)
- Liquidity conditions

In Practice:
- Bull markets: Funding can spike to extreme levels
- Bear markets: Can go significantly negative
- Neutral markets: Tends toward borrowing cost + risk premiums

For Basis Traders:
USDT strategy: Simpler but with tail risk
Inverse strategy: Higher operational complexity
Choose based on capabilities, not just rates
```

### Strategic Implications for Traders

**These are fundamentally different instruments:**

```
USDT Perps:
- Clean, predictable hedge until liquidation
- Requires USDT collateral (operational consideration)
- Discontinuous risk at liquidation point
- Suitable for: Set-and-forget hedging with tail risk management

Inverse Perps:
- Continuous position drift requiring active management
- Can use BTC as collateral (capital efficiency)
- No cliff risk but constant rebalancing needs
- Suitable for: Active traders who can manage position drift

These aren't comparable based on funding rates alone!
Each requires different operational capabilities and risk tolerance.
```

**For Basis Trading (Collecting Funding):**
```
The choice depends on your operational setup, not just rates:

USDT Perps:
- Simpler position management
- Clear risk parameters
- Need USDT capital

Inverse Perps:
- Requires active rebalancing
- Complex position dynamics
- Can use BTC as collateral

Don't choose based on funding differentials alone.
Consider: Capital availability, operational complexity,
risk management capabilities, and rebalancing costs.
```

## Collateral Mechanics

### The Critical Choice of Collateral

Your collateral choice dramatically affects risk:

**Scenario: Long ETH with different collateral**

```
Using USDT collateral:
ETH falls 50% → Need more USDT for margin
Your collateral value: Unchanged
Result: Liquidation based on position loss only

Using ETH collateral:
ETH falls 50% → Need more collateral
Your collateral value: Also down 50%
Result: Faster liquidation (double whammy effect)

Using BTC collateral:
ETH falls 50%, BTC falls 30%
Your position: Down 50%
Your collateral: Down 30%
Result: Better than ETH collateral, worse than stable
```

### Multi-Collateral Systems

Modern exchanges accept various collateral types with haircuts:

```
Binance Portfolio Margin Example:
├── USDT: 1.0 weight (full value)
├── USDC: 0.95 weight (5% haircut)
├── BTC: 0.95 weight (with volatility adjustment)
├── ETH: 0.90 weight
└── Other tokens: 0.50-0.80 weight

Key: Haircuts reflect liquidity and volatility risk
```

### Cross vs Isolated Margin

**Isolated Margin:**
```
Position A: $1,000 margin → Liquidation only affects A
Position B: $1,000 margin → Independent from A
Risk: Limited to each position
Control: Maximum
```

**Cross Margin:**
```
All positions share margin pool
Profitable positions support losing ones
Risk: One bad position can liquidate all
Efficiency: Better capital usage
```

## Post-Crisis Developments (2022-2024)

### The FTX Collapse Impact (November 2022)

FTX's failure revealed critical collateral risks:

**What went wrong:**
- FTT tokens used as collateral at inflated values
- Circular collateral (exchange token backing exchange positions)
- No haircuts on illiquid tokens
- Wrapped tokens valued at 1:1 despite liquidity issues

### Industry Response: Collateral Reform

**Binance Changes (2023-2024):**

```
Pre-Crisis:
- Wrapped tokens: 1:1 value
- Exchange tokens: Full collateral value
- No dynamic haircuts

Post-Crisis:
- Wrapped tokens: Conversion ratio based on liquidity
- Exchange tokens: Capped usage with haircuts
- Dynamic adjustments during volatility
- Auto-deleveraging transparency
```

**Wrapped Token Valuation:**
```
Example: wBTC on Binance
Before: 1 wBTC = 1 BTC collateral value
After: 1 wBTC = 0.95 BTC value (5% haircut)
During stress: Can drop to 0.80 or lower

Reasoning: Unwrapping takes time, has custody risk
```

## Options on CEXs

### European vs American Style

Most crypto options are European (exercise at expiry only):

```
European Option Lifecycle:
Buy → Hold → Expiry → Auto-exercise if ITM

American Option (rare in crypto):
Buy → Can exercise anytime → More expensive
```

### Options and Volatility

**Implied Volatility (IV) in Crypto:**
```
Traditional Markets:
Stock IV: 15-30% typical
VIX spike: 40-50% is "high"

Crypto Markets:
BTC IV: 50-80% normal
ETH IV: 60-100% normal
Alt IV: 100-200%+ common
```

### Deribit Dominance

Deribit controls ~90% of crypto options volume:

**Why Deribit Leads:**
- Deepest liquidity
- Most strikes/expiries
- Portfolio margining
- Institutional grade

**Key Features:**
```
Margining:
- Uses BTC/ETH as collateral
- Portfolio margin (cross-margining efficiency)
- Real-time risk calculations

Settlement:
- Cash-settled in crypto
- Block trades for institutions
```

## Risk Management Features

### Auto-Deleveraging (ADL)

When insurance funds deplete:

```
ADL Priority Queue:
1. Highest profit + highest leverage
2. Lower profit + highest leverage
3. Highest profit + lower leverage
4. Others

Result: Profitable traders forcibly closed to cover losses
```

### Liquidation Mechanisms

**Progressive Liquidation:**
```
Instead of: 100% position liquidated at once

Now: Tiered liquidation
- Level 1 (90% margin): Reduce 25%
- Level 2 (80% margin): Reduce 50%
- Level 3 (70% margin): Full liquidation

Benefit: Reduces cascade liquidations
```

### Insurance Funds

Each exchange maintains insurance funds:

```
Purpose:
├── Cover negative balance after liquidation
├── Prevent ADL triggering
├── Smooth liquidation losses
└── Market confidence

Funding:
- Liquidation fees
- Trading fee allocation
- Exchange contributions
```

## Practical Considerations

### Choosing Your Exchange

**For Perpetuals:**
- **Binance**: Deepest liquidity, most pairs
- **Bybit**: Popular for alts
- **OKX**: Sophisticated margin system
- **dYdX**: Decentralized alternative

**For Options:**
- **Deribit**: 90% market share, institutional grade
- **OKX**: Growing alternative
- **Binance**: Basic options only

### Collateral Strategy

**Conservative Approach:**
```
Long positions: Use stablecoin collateral
Short positions: Use asset collateral (natural hedge)
Mixed book: Diversified collateral basket
```

**Aggressive Approach:**
```
Same-asset collateral for leverage
Accept liquidation risk for capital efficiency
Use cross-margin for maximum flexibility
```

### Key Metrics to Monitor

**For Perpetuals:**
- Funding rates (market sentiment + carry cost)
- Open interest (positioning)
- Basis (perp vs spot spread)
- Liquidation levels (support/resistance)

**For Options:**
- Implied volatility (option pricing)
- Skew (put/call demand imbalance)
- Max pain (where most options expire worthless)
- Greeks (especially vega in high-vol crypto)

## Common Pitfalls

### The Leverage Trap

```
Account with $1,000
Open 100x leverage = $100,000 position
1% adverse move = Complete liquidation

Reality: Fees + spread mean liquidation often at 0.5-0.7% move
Plus: Maintenance margin requirements reduce this further
```

### Funding Rate Arbitrage Risks

Strategy: Long spot, short perp, collect funding

**Hidden Risks:**
- Execution slippage
- Exchange custody risk  
- Funding can flip negative
- Basis risk during volatility
- Non-linear position drift (for inverse perps)

### Inverse Contract Liquidation

**The Death Spiral:**
```
Short 1 BTC worth inverse at $30,000 with 0.5 BTC collateral
BTC rises to $60,000
Loss in BTC = (1/$30,000 - 1/$60,000) × $30,000 = 0.5 BTC
Collateral gone → Liquidation

Critical: As price rises, your effective short position GROWS in BTC terms
This non-linear position growth can theoretically create infinite losses
```

## Key Insights Summary

### Understanding Funding Rates
Perpetual funding rates aren't arbitrary—they represent:
1. **Base cost of carry** (borrowing costs, or arbitrage occurs)
2. **Risk premiums** (different for barrier risk vs convexity risk)
3. **Supply/demand imbalance** (crypto's structural long bias)

### Understanding Non-Linear Risk
While perpetuals are linear instruments, the interaction between:
- **Leverage** (magnifies moves)  
- **Collateral dynamics** (value changes with market)
- **Margin requirements** (liquidation mechanics)

...creates **non-linear risk profiles** that must be actively managed.

### The Two Risk Profiles
**USDT Perps**: Linear payoff with discontinuous liquidation risk
**Inverse Perps**: Continuous non-linear position dynamics requiring constant management

### Practical Wisdom
- Funding collection compensates for managing non-linear risks
- Collateral choice determines your risk profile
- Inverse perps pay higher funding due to position drift costs
- Understanding non-linearity separates traders from gamblers

## Regulatory Considerations

### Geographic Restrictions

**Derivatives Access:**
- US: Very limited (no Binance, Bybit)
- EU: Leverage caps coming via MiCA
- UK: Retail derivatives ban
- Asia: Generally permissive

### Reporting Requirements

Many jurisdictions require derivative trade reporting:
- Large position reporting
- Tax implications differ from spot
- Potential professional trader classification

## Conclusion: Instruments as Tools

Perpetuals and options are tools—neither inherently good nor bad. Their effectiveness depends entirely on how they're used. The key differentiator between gambling and trading is understanding the risks you're taking and ensuring you're adequately compensated for them.

**The Three Pillars of Derivatives Trading:**
1. **Understand the instrument** (mechanics and risks)
2. **Manage collateral wisely** (it determines survival)
3. **Respect the funding economics** (know what you're paying or receiving for)

Master these concepts, and derivatives become powerful portfolio tools rather than casino games. The goal isn't to avoid risk—it's to take only the risks you understand and are compensated for.
