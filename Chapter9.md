## Wallets: Your Gateway to Blockchain

### Understanding Wallet Types

```
Wallet Architecture:
├── Custodial (Exchange controls keys)
│   ├── CEX wallets (Binance, Coinbase)
│   ├── Pros: Easy recovery, customer support
│   └── Cons: Not your keys, counterparty risk
│
└── Non-Custodial (You control keys)
    ├── Hot Wallets (Internet-connected)
    │   ├── Browser: MetaMask, Rabby, Rainbow
    │   ├── Mobile: Trust Wallet, Argent
    │   └── Desktop: Exodus, Atomic
    │
    └── Cold Wallets (Offline storage)
        ├── Hardware: Ledger, Trezor, GridPlus
        └── Paper/Steel: Physical key backup
```

### Key Management Best Practices

**Seed Phrase Security:**
- Never enter seed phrases online
- Store physical copies in multiple secure locations
- Consider steel backup plates for fire/water resistance
- Never screenshot or digitally store seed phrases
- Test recovery process with small amounts first

**Hardware Wallet Setup:**
1. Buy directly from manufacturer (never secondhand)
2. Verify device integrity with manufacturer tools
3. Generate seed phrase on the device itself
4. Practice recovery before storing significant funds
5. Use passphrase (25th word) for additional security

### Multi-Signature Wallets

For significant holdings, multi-sig provides additional security:

```
2-of-3 Multi-sig Setup:
├── Hardware wallet 1 (primary)
├── Hardware wallet 2 (backup)
└── Trusted third party or time-locked key

Requires 2 signatures to move funds
Protects against single point of failure
```

**Popular Multi-sig Solutions:**
- **Gnosis Safe**: Industry standard for DAOs and teams
- **Casa**: User-friendly multi-sig for individuals
- **Unchained Capital**: Collaborative custody solution
