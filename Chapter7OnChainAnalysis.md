# Chapter 7: On-Chain Analytics
## Reading the Blockchain Itself - What Smart Money Can't Hide

On-chain analytics reads the blockchain directly - the immutable ledger recording every transaction since genesis. This is pure blockchain intelligence: tracking coin age, movement patterns, and wallet behavior. Unlike exchange data that can be faked, blockchain data doesn't lie. Understanding these metrics reveals what long-term holders and whales are actually doing.

---

## The Power of Blockchain Transparency

### Why On-Chain Data Is Different

**What Makes It Unique:**
- Every transaction permanently recorded
- Can't fake coin age or movement
- Whale wallets trackable forever
- Historical patterns clearly visible
- No reliance on exchange reporting

The blockchain is the ultimate source of truth. While exchanges can fake volume and traders can lie about positions, the blockchain records reality.

## Coin Days Destroyed (CDD): The Ancient Coins Metric

### Understanding CDD

**Formula:** CDD = (Number of coins moved) × (Days held unmoved)

```
Examples:
100 BTC held 1 day, then moved = 100 CDD
1 BTC held 100 days, then moved = 100 CDD
100 BTC held 365 days, then moved = 36,500 CDD
10 BTC held 10 years, then moved = 36,500 CDD

Why It Matters:
- Old coins moving = Long-term holders acting
- Spikes often precede major tops
- Low CDD = HODLers holding strong
- Can't be gamed or faked
```

### Reading CDD Patterns

**Sustained High CDD (>90th percentile):**
- Long-term holders taking profits
- Distribution to new entrants
- Often marks cycle tops
- Example: May 2021 saw 30-day average CDD spike 400%

**Single Massive Spike:**
```
January 2025 Example:
- 12-year dormant wallet activated
- Moved 500 BTC (2013 era coins)
- Created 1.8M CDD spike in one day
- Price dropped 8% within a week
- Ancient miner finally took profits
```

**CDD Divergence:**
- CDD rising while price sideways = Hidden distribution
- CDD falling while price rising = Strong hands accumulating
- CDD flat during volatility = Traders churning, holders unmoved

### Supply-Adjusted CDD

Accounts for Bitcoin's growing supply:
**Formula:** CDD ÷ Circulating Supply

This makes historical comparisons valid:
- 2013: 1M CDD meant more with 11M supply
- 2025: 1M CDD means less with 19.5M supply
- Supply-adjusted shows true relative impact

## HODL Waves: The Diamond Hands Map

### Understanding Coin Age Distribution

HODL Waves show what percentage of Bitcoin supply hasn't moved for various time periods:

```
Age Bands Breakdown:
< 24 hours: Day traders, arbitrage bots
1-7 days: Short-term traders
1-3 months: Swing traders
3-6 months: Position traders
6-12 months: Early investors
1-2 years: Committed holders
2-3 years: Strong hands
3-5 years: Diamond hands
5-10 years: OG Bitcoiners
> 10 years: Lost coins/Satoshi
```

### Reading Market Cycles Through HODL Waves

**Bottom Formation Pattern:**
```
2022-2023 Bear Market Example:
- < 3 month coins: Dropped from 25% to 15%
- > 1 year coins: Rose from 55% to 65%
- > 5 year coins: Stayed steady at 25%
Interpretation: Weak hands sold to strong hands
```

**Top Formation Pattern:**
```
2021 Bull Market Peak:
- < 3 month coins: Spiked from 15% to 30%
- 2-5 year coins: Dropped from 30% to 20%
- Pattern: Old holders distributing to new buyers
Signal: Cycle top forming
```

### Realized Cap HODL Waves

Weights coins by the price when they last moved:
- Shows the "cost basis" of different age groups
- More accurate than regular HODL waves
- Reveals profit/loss status of cohorts

---

## SOPR: The Psychology of Profit and Loss

### Spent Output Profit Ratio Explained

**Formula:** (Value when sold) ÷ (Value when acquired)

```
SOPR Interpretation:
> 1.0 = Coins sold in profit
< 1.0 = Coins sold at loss
= 1.0 = Break-even (key psychological level)

Market Psychology:
Bull Market: SOPR repeatedly bounces off 1.0
Bear Market: SOPR repeatedly rejected at 1.0
```

### Long-Term Holder SOPR (LTH-SOPR)

Filters for coins held >155 days:

```
LTH-SOPR Signals:
> 3.0 = Long-termers taking 3x+ profits (cycle top)
< 1.0 = Diamond hands capitulating (cycle bottom)
1.5-2.5 = Healthy profit-taking zone

Historical Examples:
Dec 2017: LTH-SOPR hit 5.0 (top)
Dec 2018: LTH-SOPR hit 0.6 (bottom)
April 2021: LTH-SOPR hit 4.2 (local top)
June 2022: LTH-SOPR hit 0.7 (bottom)
```

## UTXO Analysis: Following the Coins

### What Are UTXOs?

Unspent Transaction Outputs - Bitcoin's accounting method:
- Each UTXO is like a bill in your wallet
- Has a specific value and age
- Must be fully spent when used
- Change creates new UTXOs

### UTXO Age Bands

```
UTXO Realized Price Distribution:
< $20k: Bear market 2022 buyers
$20-30k: 2023 accumulation
$30-50k: 2024 rally buyers
$50-69k: 2024-25 FOMO buyers
> $69k: 2021 top buyers (underwater)
```

### UTXO Profit/Loss Metrics

**Percent of UTXOs in Profit:**
- > 95% = Extreme greed, everyone winning
- 70-95% = Bull market conditions
- 50-70% = Transitional phase
- < 50% = Bear market, majority underwater

---

## Network Health Metrics

### Active Addresses

```
Not All Addresses Are Equal:
- Daily active: 800k-1M (normal)
- > 1.2M = Heightened activity
- < 600k = Network dormancy

But Filter for Value:
- Addresses moving >$10k (whale activity)
- Addresses moving <$100 (retail/spam)
- First-time addresses (new adoption)
```

### Entity-Adjusted Metrics

Clusters addresses belonging to same entity:
- Removes exchange internal shuffling
- Shows real economic actors
- More accurate user count
- Currently ~300k daily entities

### Network Value Metrics

**NVT (Network Value to Transactions):**
```
Formula: Market Cap ÷ Transaction Value
Interpretation:
< 50 = Network undervalued vs usage
50-100 = Fair value range
> 100 = Overvalued/speculative
> 150 = Bubble conditions
```

**MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value):**
```
Formula: Market Cap ÷ Realized Cap
Historical Zones:
< 1.0 = Below aggregate cost basis (bear)
1.0-2.5 = Equilibrium zone
2.5-3.5 = Overheated
> 3.5 = Cycle top territory
```

## Miner Behavior: The Forced Sellers

### Understanding Miner Dynamics

Miners have ongoing costs and must sell:
- Electricity bills don't accept Bitcoin
- Hardware financing needs fiat
- Most sophisticated about timing
- Always forced sellers to some degree

### What Is Hash Rate?

**Simple Definition:** Hash rate = Total computing power of all Bitcoin miners combined

Think of it like a global competition where millions of computers are trying to solve puzzles to mine Bitcoin. Hash rate measures how many attempts per second the entire network makes. 

```
Higher hash rate = More miners/machines competing
Lower hash rate = Fewer miners/machines competing

Current Bitcoin hash rate: ~450 EH/s
That's 450 quintillion calculations per second!
```

**Why It Matters:**
- **Rising hash rate** = Miners investing in equipment (confident in Bitcoin's future)
- **Falling hash rate** = Miners shutting down (unprofitable, capitulating)
- **Security measure** = Higher hash rate makes network more secure

Hash rate follows price with a lag - when Bitcoin price drops, unprofitable miners shut off machines, hash rate falls. When price rises, mining becomes profitable, more miners join, hash rate rises.

### Reading Miner Data Despite Constant Selling

**Normal Baseline (The Noise):**
```
Typical Daily Operations:
- Miners produce ~900 BTC/day (current, post-2024 halving)
- Usually sell 50-70% immediately for operations
- Hold 30-50% as treasury/speculation
- This is normal - always happening
```

**What Actually Matters - CHANGES in Behavior:**
```
Accumulation Signal:
- Selling <40% of production (building reserves)
- Treasury balance increasing
- Hash rate stable/growing
= Miners bullish, can afford to hold

Distribution Signal:
- Selling 70-90% of production
- Treasury balance flat/declining slowly
= Miners cautious, selling to market

Capitulation Signal:
- Selling >100% of production (dipping into reserves)
- Treasury balance declining rapidly  
- Hash rate dropping (weakest miners offline)
= Miners in distress, forced liquidation
```

### Key Miner Metrics

**Hash Ribbons**
Tracks 30-day and 60-day mining hash rate MAs:
```
Capitulation Signal:
- 30-day MA crosses below 60-day MA
- Weak miners shutting down
- Historically marks bottoms

Recovery Signal:
- 30-day crosses back above
- Mining profitable again
- New accumulation phase begins
```

**Miner Position Index (MPI)**
```
Formula: (USD outflow from miners) ÷ (365-day MA)

Reading the MPI:
< 0 = Miners holding more than usual (bullish)
0-2 = Normal operational selling
> 2 = Excessive selling (bearish)
> 3 = Capitulation (extreme, often marks bottom)
```

**Miner Net Position Change**
Daily change in miner Bitcoin holdings:
```
Rising treasury = Accumulation (very bullish)
Flat treasury = Status quo operations
Declining slowly = Marginal stress
Declining rapidly = Capitulation

Real Examples:
2020-2021 Bull: Treasuries grew 50k → 80k BTC
2022 Bear: Miners sold 30,000 BTC in 6 months
- Treasuries hit multi-year lows
- Marked the cycle bottom
```

### Why Miner Capitulation Marks Bottoms

1. **Maximum Pain Point**: Miners are most informed (know mining economics)
2. **Forced Sellers Exhausted**: Once reserves gone, selling ends
3. **Survival of Fittest**: Only efficient miners remain
4. **Hash Recovery Signal**: Indicates profitability returning

When hash ribbons flip negative AND miners empty treasuries, it's historically been the best buying opportunity.

### Where to Get This Data

**Free Sources:**
- **LookIntoBitcoin.com**: Hash Ribbons chart
- **Blockchain.com**: Raw hash rate data
- **CryptoQuant Free**: Basic miner flows

**Professional ($30-40/month):**
- **Glassnode**: Complete miner suite with MPI
- **CryptoQuant Advanced**: Real-time alerts
- **ByteTree**: Miner's Rolling Inventory (MRI)

### The Smart Interpretation

**Don't Focus On:** Daily miner selling (too noisy)
**Do Focus On:** Monthly trend changes in:
- Percentage of production sold
- Treasury balance direction
- Hash rate trends

**Key Questions:**
- Are miners selling MORE or LESS than their usual 50-70%?
- Is their treasury GROWING or SHRINKING?
- Is hash rate RISING or FALLING?

The answers reveal if miners (despite being forced sellers) are optimistic or pessimistic. When the most informed forced sellers capitulate, it's often the absolute bottom.

## Wallet Cohort Analysis

### Tracking Different Player Types

**Shrimp (<1 BTC):** Retail investors
**Crab (1-10 BTC):** Serious retail
**Fish (10-100 BTC):** Wealthy individuals
**Dolphin (100-500 BTC):** Small funds
**Shark (500-1000 BTC):** Large traders
**Whale (1000-5000 BTC):** Institutions
**Humpback (>5000 BTC):** Exchanges/massive funds

### Supply Distribution Shifts

```
Current Distribution (Oct 2025):
Shrimp-Crab: 15% of supply (growing)
Fish-Dolphin: 30% of supply (stable)
Shark-Whale: 35% of supply (accumulating)
Humpback: 20% of supply (exchanges/funds)

Bullish when: Sharks/Whales accumulating
Bearish when: Sharks/Whales distributing
```

### The Plankton Indicator

When shrimp (<1 BTC) supply percentage rises rapidly:
- Retail FOMO has arrived
- Distribution phase active
- Local top forming

---

## Ethereum Staking Metrics

### Understanding ETH 2.0 Staking Dynamics

Since Ethereum's transition to Proof of Stake, staking metrics reveal network security and investor confidence:

**Total Value Staked**
```
Current: ~36M ETH staked (30% of supply)
What it shows:
- Rising = Long-term confidence growing
- Flat = Equilibrium reached
- Falling = Would require withdrawals (bearish)

Key Thresholds:
< 20% supply = Early adoption
20-30% = Healthy participation
> 40% = Potential staking saturation
```

**Staking Inflow/Outflow**
```
Large Inflows (>100k ETH/day):
- Institutional staking
- Long-term bullish positioning
- Supply being locked up

Declining Inflows:
- Staking demand saturated
- Yields becoming less attractive
- Short-term bearish
```

**ETH 2.0 Staking Rate (%)**
- Percentage of total ETH supply staked
- Higher % = More supply locked (bullish for price)
- Monitor rate of change more than absolute level

**New Depositors vs Total Depositors**
```
Rising New Depositors:
- Fresh adoption
- Retail FOMO potentially

Declining New Depositors:
- Staking maturity
- Only sophisticated players left
```

### Why Staking Metrics Matter

**Supply Shock Mechanism:**
- Staked ETH locked (can't sell immediately)
- Withdrawal queue during panic (dampens selling)
- Creates artificial supply scarcity

**Confidence Indicator:**
- Staking = 4-5% yield but ETH price risk
- Large staking inflows = Investors prefer ETH over stables
- Shows long-term belief in Ethereum

**Watch for Divergences:**
- Price falling but staking rising = Accumulation
- Price rising but staking flat = Short-term traders driving
- Withdrawal queue spikes = Panic (rare but important)

## Lost Coins and Dormancy

### Estimating Lost Bitcoin

```
Assumed Lost Categories:
- Satoshi's coins (1M BTC): Never moved
- 2009-2011 unmoved (2M BTC): Likely lost
- Known burn addresses: Provably lost
- Total estimated lost: 3-4M BTC

This means:
- Real supply ~16M not 19.5M
- Makes all metrics more bullish
- Increases scarcity premium
```

### Dormancy Flow

Tracks the average age of coins moved daily:
- High dormancy = Old coins waking up
- Low dormancy = Only young coins moving
- Spikes = Long-term holders acting

---

## Advanced On-Chain Patterns

### The Capitulation Cascade

```
Week 1: Miners start selling reserves
Week 2: 6-12 month holders capitulate
Week 3: 1-2 year holders break
Week 4: Entity count drops (users leaving)
Week 5: Maximum pain, bottom forms
```

### The Accumulation Staircase

```
Month 1: Whale addresses increase holdings
Month 2: Exchange balances decline
Month 3: CDD remains low despite volatility
Month 4: Old coins stop moving completely
Month 5: Entity count starts rising
Month 6: Breakout begins
```

### The Distribution Fingerprint

```
Phase 1: 5+ year coins start moving (CDD spikes)
Phase 2: Coins split to multiple addresses
Phase 3: Gradual flow to exchanges
Phase 4: SOPR rises above 2.0
Phase 5: Young coin percentage spikes
Phase 6: Price tops, cycle completes
```

---

## Limitations of On-Chain Analysis

### What It Can't Tell You

- **Exact price targets** (shows behavior, not levels)
- **Exchange internals** (off-chain activity hidden)
- **Derivative impacts** (futures/options off-chain)
- **Identity certainty** (addresses ≠ people)
- **Lost vs HODL** (dormant could be either)

### The Context Requirement

On-chain works best combined with:
- Market structure (separate chapter)
- Macro environment
- Technical levels
- Sentiment extremes

---

## Building Your On-Chain Framework

### Daily Health Check (5 minutes)
1. CDD trend (spiking or calm?)
2. SOPR level (profit or loss?)
3. Miner position (selling or holding?)

### Weekly Deep Dive (30 minutes)
1. HODL Waves shifts
2. Entity growth/decline
3. Whale accumulation/distribution
4. Dormancy patterns

### Monthly Cycle Review (1 hour)
1. MVRV position
2. NVT trends
3. Supply distribution changes
4. Lost coin adjustments

---

## Key Takeaways

**On-chain data is blockchain truth:**
- Can't be faked or manipulated
- Shows what holders actually do
- Reveals accumulation/distribution
- Catches tops and bottoms

**Most powerful metrics:**
1. **CDD** - When old coins move, pay attention
2. **HODL Waves** - Shows who's in control
3. **SOPR** - Psychology of profit/loss
4. **MVRV** - Aggregate profit/loss position
5. **Miner behavior** - The forced sellers

**The edge:** 
While everyone watches price charts and exchange data, on-chain shows what's happening beneath - whether diamond hands are accumulating or distributing. In a transparent blockchain, following smart money footprints is your alpha.

*Next Chapter: Market Intelligence - Exchange Flows, Derivatives, and Trading Signals*# Chapter 7: On-Chain Analytics
## Reading the Blockchain Itself - What Smart Money Can't Hide

Unlike exchange data or derivatives metrics, on-chain analytics reads the blockchain directly - the immutable ledger that records every transaction since genesis. This is pure blockchain intelligence: what's actually happening on-chain, not what exchanges report or what traders claim. Understanding these metrics reveals what whales are actually doing with their coins.

---

## The Fundamental Advantage of On-Chain Data

### Why Pure Blockchain Data Matters

**Off-Chain Data (Exchange/Trading):**
- Funding rates, open interest (exchange reported)
- Order books, liquidations (can be spoofed)
- Volume (often fake/wash trading)
- Requires trusting exchanges

**On-Chain Data (Blockchain Native):**
- Every transaction permanently# Chapter 7: On-Chain Analytics
## Reading the Blockchain's Tea Leaves Before Price Moves

While technical analysis reads price charts, on-chain analysis reads the blockchain itself - tracking what whales do, not what they say. These metrics often signal major moves days or weeks before price reacts. Understanding them separates informed traders from exit liquidity.

---

## The Fundamental Advantage of On-Chain Data

### Why Blockchain Analytics Matter

**Traditional Markets:**
- Hedge funds trade in darkness
- 13F filings lag by 45 days
- Dark pools hide large trades
- You find out after the move

**Crypto Markets:**
- Every transaction is public
- Real-time whale tracking
- No hiding large moves
- You see it as it happens

The blockchain is a transparent ledger showing every coin movement since genesis. Smart money knows this and uses on-chain data to front-run retail who only watch price charts.

---

## Exchange Flows: The Most Direct Signal

### Exchange Reserves - The Supply/Demand Proxy

**What It Measures:** Total coins sitting on exchanges ready to sell

```
Falling Exchange Reserves = Bullish
- Coins moving to cold storage
- Supply shock developing
- HODLers accumulating

Rising Exchange Reserves = Bearish
- Coins moving to sell
- Supply increasing
- Distribution phase

Current BTC on Exchanges (Oct 2025):
- 2.3M BTC (~11% of supply)
- Down from 3.2M in 2020
- Lowest since 2018
Source: Glassnode
```

### Exchange Inflow/Outflow Patterns

**Reading the Flow Signals:**

```
Large Inflows (>$10M):
├── To spot exchanges → Likely selling
├── To derivative exchanges → Likely collateral
├── Multiple exchanges → Distribution
└── Asian exchanges at 3 AM → Whale games

Large Outflows:
├── To unknown wallets → Cold storage (bullish)
├── To DeFi protocols → Yield farming
├── To known OTC desks → Institutional buying
└── Pattern over days → Accumulation phase
```

**The 7-Day Moving Average Rule:**
Single-day spikes are noise. Watch the 7-day average:
- Consistent inflows + price stable = Distribution (bearish)
- Consistent outflows + price stable = Accumulation (bullish)
- Sudden spike + price dump = Capitulation

### Exchange Whale Ratio

**Formula:** (Top 10 inflow transactions) ÷ (Total inflow)

```
Reading the Ratio:
> 85% = Whales dominating (extreme move coming)
60-85% = Whale activity elevated
40-60% = Normal market
< 40% = Retail dominating (local top/bottom)

Example Signal:
March 2025: Whale ratio hit 89% on Binance
Next 48 hours: BTC dropped 12%
Whales were dumping while retail bought
```

---

## Coin Days Destroyed (CDD): The Ancient Coins Metric

### Understanding CDD

**Formula:** CDD = (Number of coins moved) × (Days held unmoved)

```
Examples:
100 BTC held 1 day, then moved = 100 CDD
1 BTC held 100 days, then moved = 100 CDD
100 BTC held 365 days, then moved = 36,500 CDD

Why It Matters:
- Old coins moving = Long-term holders selling
- Spikes often precede major tops
- Low CDD = HODLers holding strong
```

### Types of CDD Signals

**Binary CDD:** Simply whether old coins moved (1) or not (0)
**Value-Weighted CDD:** Actual CDD value
**Supply-Adjusted CDD:** CDD ÷ circulating supply (comparable across time)

### Reading CDD Patterns

```
Sustained High CDD (>90th percentile):
- Long-term holders taking profits
- Often marks cycle tops
- Example: May 2021, Nov 2021 peaks

CDD Spike + Price Stable:
- Smart money distributing quietly
- Bearish divergence developing
- Watch for delayed price reaction

CDD Low + Price Rising:
- New money buying, old money holding
- Healthy bull market
- Continuation likely
```

**The 2025 Example:**
```
January 2025 Event:
- 12-year dormant wallet moved 500 BTC
- Created 1.8M CDD spike
- Price dropped 8% over next week
- Ancient miner finally took profits
```

---

## HODL Waves: The Age Distribution Map

### What HODL Waves Show

Unlike CDD which tracks movement, HODL Waves show the static distribution of coins by age.

```
Typical Age Bands:
< 24 hours (hot money)
1-7 days (traders)
1-3 months (swing traders)
3-6 months (position traders)
6-12 months (investors)
1-2 years (HODLers)
2-3 years (strong hands)
3-5 years (diamond hands)
5-10 years (OGs)
> 10 years (Satoshi's coins)
```

### Reading HODL Wave Patterns

**Bottom Formation:**
```
Signal: Young bands (<6 months) shrinking
        Old bands (>1 year) growing
Meaning: Weak hands sold to strong hands
Action: Accumulation zone
```

**Top Formation:**
```
Signal: Old bands (>2 years) shrinking
        Young bands (<3 months) growing
Meaning: HODLers distributing to retail
Action: Take profits
```

**The Realized Cap HODL Waves:**
Weights coins by the price when they last moved, showing the "real" market cap of different age cohorts.

---

## The SOPR Signal: Profit and Loss Psychology

### Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR)

**Formula:** (Value sold) ÷ (Value when acquired)

```
SOPR Reading:
> 1 = Coins sold in profit
< 1 = Coins sold at loss
= 1 = Breakeven (key psychological level)

Market Psychology:
- SOPR repeatedly bouncing off 1.0 = Bull market support
- SOPR repeatedly failing at 1.0 = Bear market resistance
- SOPR sustained >1.05 = Euphoria (top near)
- SOPR sustained <0.95 = Capitulation (bottom near)
```

### Long-Term Holder SOPR

Filters for coins held >155 days (statistically proven holding period):
- LTH-SOPR >3 = Long-termers taking 3x profits (cycle top)
- LTH-SOPR <1 = Diamond hands selling at loss (max pain)

---

## Network Value Metrics: Fair Value Models

### NVT Ratio (Network Value to Transactions)

**Formula:** Market Cap ÷ Daily Transaction Value

```
Think P/E Ratio for Crypto:
NVT < 50 = Undervalued
NVT 50-100 = Fair value
NVT > 100 = Overvalued
NVT > 150 = Bubble territory

BTC NVT History:
- 2017 peak: 150+
- 2021 peak: 120
- Bear market: 40-60
- Current (Oct 2025): 75
```

### MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value)

**Formula:** Market Cap ÷ Realized Cap

```
MVRV Zones:
< 0.7 = Deep value (generational bottom)
0.7-1.0 = Accumulation zone
1.0-2.5 = Fair value
2.5-3.5 = Overheated
> 3.5 = Extreme greed (cycle top)

Historical Tops/Bottoms:
- 2017 top: 4.8
- 2018 bottom: 0.7
- 2021 top: 3.9
- 2022 bottom: 0.75
```

---

## Miner and Validator Metrics

### Miner Revenue and Capitulation

```
Hash Ribbons Indicator:
- 30-day MA crosses below 60-day MA = Miner capitulation
- Weakest miners shutting down
- Historically marks bottoms

Miner Position Index (MPI):
MPI = (Miner outflows) ÷ (365-day MA)
> 2 = Miners selling heavily (bearish)
< 0 = Miners accumulating (bullish)
```

### Puell Multiple

**Formula:** (Daily miner revenue) ÷ (365-day MA revenue)

```
Reading:
< 0.5 = Miners in pain (bottom near)
0.5-1.0 = Accumulation zone
1.0-2.0 = Normal market
2.0-4.0 = Take profits
> 4.0 = Cycle top imminent
```

---

## DeFi and Stablecoin Signals

### Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR)

**Formula:** Bitcoin Market Cap ÷ Stablecoin Market Cap

```
Low SSR = Lots of dry powder (bullish)
High SSR = No buying power left (bearish)

Current (Oct 2025):
BTC Cap: $1.4T
Stablecoin Cap: $165B
SSR: 8.5 (historically neutral)
```

### Stablecoin Exchange Flows

```
Stables Flowing to Exchanges:
- Immediate: Someone's about to buy
- Sustained: Accumulation phase
- Spike during dump: Buy the dip crowd

Stables Leaving Exchanges:
- To DeFi: Risk-off, yield farming
- To wallets: Waiting on sidelines
- During rally: FOMO exhausted
```

### DeFi TVL Flows

```
TVL Rising + Price Stable = Accumulation
TVL Rising + Price Rising = Healthy growth
TVL Falling + Price Rising = Unsustainable pump
TVL Falling + Price Falling = Capitulation
```

---

## Futures and Derivatives Indicators

### Funding Rates (Covered in Trading Chapter)
Just remember: Sustained >0.1% = Overleveraged longs

### Open Interest Changes

```
OI Rising + Price Rising = Trend continuation
OI Rising + Price Flat = Breakout imminent
OI Falling + Price Rising = Short squeeze
OI Falling + Price Falling = Long liquidations
```

### The Kimchi Premium and Regional Flows

```
Korea Premium > 3% = Retail FOMO peak
Negative Premium = Extreme fear
Premium Arbitrage Closing = Whale games ending
```

---

---

## Common Patterns Before Major Moves

### The Distribution Pattern (Top)

```
Week 1-2: Old coins start moving (CDD spike)
Week 2-3: Exchange inflows increase
Week 3-4: Whale ratio rises
Week 4-5: Retail FOMO peaks (Korea premium)
Week 5-6: Price tops and reverses
```

### The Accumulation Pattern (Bottom)

```
Week 1-2: Miner capitulation (hash ribbons)
Week 2-4: Exchange outflows sustained
Week 4-6: Old coins stop moving (CDD low)
Week 6-8: MVRV hits bottom zone
Week 8-10: Slow price recovery begins
```

### The Whale Dump Signal

```

## The Reality of On-Chain Analysis

### What It Can Do
- Spot whale movements before price impact
- Identify accumulation/distribution phases
- Confirm or invalidate technical analysis
- Time cycle tops/bottoms better
- Avoid being exit liquidity

### What It Can't Do
- Predict exact price levels
- Time moves to the hour
- Account for macro events
- Replace risk management
- Work in isolation

### The Integration Approach

Best results come from combining:
1. **On-chain**: What whales are doing
2. **Technical**: Where price might react
3. **Sentiment**: What retail believes
4. **Macro**: What affects all markets
5. **Fundamentals**: What's actually building

## Key Takeaways

**The Power of Transparency:**
- Every Bitcoin/Ethereum transaction is public
- Whales can't hide their moves
- Smart money leaves footprints
- Following these footprints = alpha

**The Most Reliable Signals:**
1. **Exchange flows** - Most direct supply/demand
2. **CDD spikes** - Old coins rarely move without reason
3. **HODL waves** - Shows who's in control
4. **MVRV extremes** - Mean reversion is powerful
5. **Miner behavior** - They know the mining economics

**The Workflow:**
1. Check macro on-chain health (MVRV, NVT)
2. Monitor exchange flows (reserves, whale ratio)
3. Watch for old coins moving (CDD, HODL waves)
4. Confirm with derivatives (funding, OI)
5. Set alerts for extreme readings

**The Bottom Line:**
On-chain data shows you what's happening beneath the surface - whether whales are accumulating while retail panics, or distributing while retail FOMOs. In a market where everyone has access to the same price charts, on-chain analytics is your edge. The blockchain doesn't lie, but you need to know how to read it.
